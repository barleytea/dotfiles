# Services Configuration

This document provides information about the services configured in this dotfiles repository, focusing on window management with yabai and keyboard shortcuts with skhd.

## Yabai

[Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) is a tiling window manager for macOS that allows you to organize your windows in a more efficient way.

### Installation and Setup

Yabai is installed and configured through Nix using both darwin-nix and home-manager:

- The system-level service is configured in `darwin/service/yabai/default.nix`
- The user-level configuration is in `home-manager/yabai/yabairc`

### Starting and Stopping Yabai

To start, stop, or restart the yabai service:

```bash
# Start yabai
yabai --start-service

# Stop yabai
yabai --stop-service

# Restart yabai
yabai --restart-service
```

When using Nix, the service is managed by launchd:

```bash
# Check status
launchctl list | grep yabai

# Manual restart
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/org.nixos.yabai
```

### Key Features

To start, stop, or restart the skhd service:

```bash
# Start skhd
skhd --start-service

# Stop skhd
skhd --stop-service

# Restart skhd
skhd --restart-service
```

When using Nix, the service is managed by launchd:

```bash
# Check status
launchctl list | grep skhd

# Manual restart
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/org.nixos.skhd
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues with Yabai

- **Scripting Addition not loaded**: Ensure System Integrity Protection (SIP) is properly configured
- **Windows not tiling**: Check if the application has a rule to be managed
- **Keyboard shortcuts not working**: Verify skhd is running and check for conflicts with system shortcuts

### Logs and Debugging

To view logs for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Yabai logs
tail -f /tmp/yabai_$(whoami).log

# Skhd logs
tail -f /tmp/skhd_$(whoami).log
```

## Customization

To customize the configuration:

1. Edit `home-manager/yabai/yabairc` for yabai settings
2. Edit the skhd configuration file for keyboard shortcuts
3. Run `home-manager switch` to apply changes
4. Restart the services to apply the new configuration
